### Query Processing Pipeline

```
Voice Input ‚Üí Speech Recognition ‚Üí Language Detection ‚Üí AI Processing ‚Üí Intent Classification ‚Üí Command Execution ‚Üí Response Generation ‚Üí Text-to-Speech
```

## üîß Configuration

### API Configuration

Update `mistral_config.py` to customize AI behavior:

```python
# Model settings
self.model = "mistral-large-latest"
self.max_tokens = 150
self.temperature = 0.6
```

### Voice Settings

Modify speech settings in `Assistance_SYRA_Final.py`:

```python
# Speech recognition settings
recognizer.energy_threshold = 300
recognizer.pause_threshold = 0.6

# TTS speed settings
os.system('afplay -r 1.2 output.mp3')  # 1.2x speed
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Microphone Access Denied
**Problem**: `‚ùå Microphone access denied or not available!`

**Solution**:
1. Open System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí Privacy
2. Click "Microphone" in the left sidebar
3. Find your terminal/Python application in the list
4. Check the box to enable microphone access
5. Restart the application

#### 2. API Key Error
**Problem**: `ValueError: Mistral API key is required`

**Solution**:
1. Ensure you have a valid Mistral AI API key
2. Update the key in `Assistance_SYRA_Final.py`:
   ```python
   MISTRAL_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"
   ```
3. Or set as environment variable:
   ```bash
   export MISTRAL_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

#### 3. Speech Recognition Issues
**Problem**: "Could not understand audio" or "Could not connect to the server"

**Solutions**:
- Check internet connection (required for Google Speech API)
- Ensure microphone is working properly
- Speak clearly and avoid background noise
- Try adjusting microphone sensitivity in system settings

#### 4. Application Not Opening
**Problem**: Applications fail to open with voice commands

**Solutions**:
- Ensure applications are installed in `/Applications/` folder
- Check application names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Try using full application names: "Microsoft Word" instead of "Word"
- Verify macOS accessibility permissions

#### 5. Weather Data Not Available
**Problem**: Weather queries return errors

**Solutions**:
- Check internet connection
- Verify location name is correct and recognizable
- Try major city names if specific locations don't work
- Wait a moment and try again (API rate limiting)

#### 6. TTS/Audio Issues
**Problem**: No voice output or audio errors

**Solutions**:
- Check system audio settings
- Ensure speakers/headphones are connected
- Try installing `mpg123` as fallback: `brew install mpg123`
- Verify `afplay` is available (built into macOS)

### Performance Optimization

#### For Better Response Times
1. **Optimize internet connection** - AI requires internet access
2. **Close unnecessary applications** - Frees up system resources
3. **Speak clearly** - Reduces recognition retry attempts
4. **Use specific commands** - More direct commands process faster

#### For Better Accuracy
1. **Use natural language** - SYRA understands conversational queries
2. **Be specific with locations** - "Melbourne Australia" vs just "Melbourne"
3. **Include context** - "Search video of Tesla" vs just "Tesla"
4. **Wait for response** - Let SYRA finish before next command

### Debug Mode

Enable debug output by adding this to your command:
```bash
python Assistance_SYRA_Final.py --verbose
```

Check logs in `conversations.txt` for detailed interaction history.
